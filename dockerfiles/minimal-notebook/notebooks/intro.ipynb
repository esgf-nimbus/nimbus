    "# FAQ\n",
    "### How do I create new conda environments?\n",
    ">You can create new conda environments using the terminal by entering the following commands.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Using conda\n",
    "# https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/index.html\n",
    "conda create -n <env> <packages>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using mamba a C++ implementation of conda, usually faster\n",
    "# https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html\n",
    "mamba create -n <env> <packages>\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Are my conda environments persistent?\n",
    "> All user created environments are persistent.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> User created environments are stored in `/home/jovyan/conda-envs`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> To override any of conda's settings, create `~/.condarc` to customize. Reference conda's [documention](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html) for options.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Anything installed in the base environment **will not** persist.\n",
    "### Why does my conda environment not appear in a notebook?\n",
    "> You may need to install and register your conda environment using `ipykernel` with the following command.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "conda activate <env>\n",
    "mamba install ipykernel\n",
    "python -m ipykernel install --user --name <env>\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Once you've ran this command you can refresh your browser and the new `<env>` kernel should appear as an option.\n",
    "### What kind of software management is there?\n",
    "> The only software management we provide is through conda.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You can search for packages using the following command\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Using conda\n",
    "conda search <package>\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using mamba\n",
    "mamba search <package>\n",
    "```\n",
    "> Or using https://anaconda.org/\n",
    "### Can I install host packages?\n",
    "> We do not provide the functionality to manage packages on the host system.\n",
    "### Can I install compilers?\n",
    "> You have access to all the gnu compilers via conda. The following command will search for all available compilers.\n",
    "```bash \n",
    "# Using conda\n",
    "conda search \"*_linux-64\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using mamba\n",
    "mamba search \"*_linux-64\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Can I write/run MPI programs?\n",
    "> When you install your compiler of choice you can specify the mpi variant you want. The possible choices are openmpi and mpich.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Using conda\n",
    "conda install gcc_linux-64 openmpi\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using mamba\n",
    "mamba install gcc_linux-64 openmpi\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Why can I not find `xyz` program?\n",
    "> If you cannot find program `xyz`, first try search conda. If you still cannot find the package open an [issue](https://github.com/esgf-compute/nimbus/issues/new).\n",
    "### I cannot access `xyz` site?\n",
    "> If you cannot access an external site, open an [issue](https://github.com/esgf-compute/nimbus/issues/new) and we'll investigate.\n",
    "### What services do I have access to?\n",
    "> You have access to [`dask-gateway`](https://gateway.dask.org/install-kube.html#connecting-to-the-gateway).\n",
    "### Can I deploy software on the Kubernetes cluster?\n",
    "> You do not have access to Kubernetes, this is in order to provide fair access to resources.\n",
    "### What storage do I have access to?\n",
    "> Your home directory is a persistent 20GB.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You have access to 1TB of shared storage between all users.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The `/p` mount provides access to all the local data. There is a shortcut in your home directory called `local-data`.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You also have access to 5TB of object storage at `http://minio-shared.jupyterhub.svc:9000`.\n",
    "### Why is there a `conda-envs` in my home directory?\n",
    "> This is the directory storing your persistent conda environments.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In order to change this create a `~/.condarc` file and define `envs_dirs:`, reference conda's [documentation](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html#advanced-configuration).\n",
    "### Why is there a `local-data` in my home directory?\n",
    "> This is a directory containing shortcuts to local data.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - /p\n",
    "> - /shared\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This can be disabled by creating a `.disable-local-data-shortcut` in your home directory.\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "touch ~/.disable-local-data-shortcut\n",
    "```\n",
    "> To enable this feature, remove the `.disable-local-data-shortcut` file.\n",
    "### Why is there a `intro.ipynb` in my home directory?\n",
    "> This is the `Nimbus` introduction guide. It's provided to keep you updated on changes and provide access to an FAQ.\n",
